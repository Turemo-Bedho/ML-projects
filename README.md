# CubeSat Image Classification – Byte Force G8  

## Overview  

This project was developed for the **Ethiopia Data Science Hackathon** by **Byte Force G8**. The goal was to classify CubeSat images using **lightweight machine learning models** to prioritize image transmission efficiently. Instead of deep learning (CNNs), we used classical ML models to ensure **high accuracy with low computational cost**.  

## Team & Contributions  

- **Turemo Bedaso** – **Team Leader & Lead Developer** (Main Code Contributor)  
- Byte Force G8 Team – Data preprocessing, model experimentation, and evaluation  

## Approach  

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization.  
- **Model Selection**: Used classical ML models like **SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost** instead of CNNs for efficiency.  
- **Optimization**: Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy and performance.  

## Results  

✅ **Lightweight & Efficient** – Optimized for resource-limited environments.  
✅ **High Accuracy** – Achieved strong classification performance.  
✅ **Scalable** – Can be adapted for other satellite image classification tasks.
